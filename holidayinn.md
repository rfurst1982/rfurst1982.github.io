**Holiday Inn**  
**Austin, Tx**  
Staff is nice, rooms are clean, and the few times I've used the shower the water pressure was a little low and took time to get hot. I've gotta make sure my Avengers plug set is nice and clean for storage. I hate storing The Hulk when he is more brown than green. Iron Man can be a little brown cause he is a sh!thead anyway. 

The beds are good and don't squeak especially when I'm drilling for love with my rent-a-honies and co-workers. They tell me the bedspreads don't leave burn marks on their chests or knees. Sadly, it chafes my knees, so now I just stand on the floor with my socks on. I never trust the floors in a hotel room.

Make sure you get a receipt so you can use it on your expense report when tou file it as a business meeting and training at the local Holiday Inn.
