**The Driskill**  
**Austin, TX**  
This place is huanted! And it is great! I brought my wife here for our honeymoon and when we were consumating our marriage we felt another set of hands on us! We were freaked out but then I broke out my SB7 and we talked to the spirit and found out it was a man whose wife left him on his wedding day in this room and he was never able to get over it. We included him for a spooky three-way and he said he'd always remember it and would wait for us for the next time. 

Now when I come here, it isn't with my wife but with other lady friends so we can have a freaky spooky time and keep Edgar (the spirit) happy and hopefully we'll be able to help him move on to the afterlife once we find a girl who reminds him of his bride who jilted him all those years ago. Until then, I'm enjoying the freaky foreplay, spirit-induced orgasms and beautiful rooms.
