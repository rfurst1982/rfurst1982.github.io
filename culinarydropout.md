This is where I picked up the nickname "The Legend" from my crew when I convinced a group of fine ladies to have dinner and drinks and a lot more with my nerdy bros. If you're a single guy (or even married like me) this is a great spot to meet like minded women and engage in some conversation and play that might lead to something more.

The food is great if you strike out in the game and the drinks are great to help you regain that broken confidence when you've shot your shot and missed. I take my son with me here because, well, women love men with kids, they're the ultimate weapon to working your way into a conversation with the ladies. And, they have kid friendly games too.
