**Motel 6**

The staff is nice enough, they take cash, and give you receipts so that your company can reimburse you for only staying here an hour before you leave and go elsewhere.

The beds squeak which is a little annoying when I am training my female friends on the finer points of pegging and drilling with The Hulk plug while dry. As a plus, the shower is clean, the water is warm and there are a few ways out so that my wife can't see me  and my sweet new silver Range Rocer leave on the off chance she drives by with our kid looking for me while I'm out for a business lunch.
