**Cedar Park, TX**  
The hotel is out of the way which is awesome cause my wife won't come looking for me out in Cedar Park for my business meetings if you catch my drift. The conference rooms have nice, clean beds, and are well insulated so no one can hear my confidential discussions with my contract employees during the power lunch. The price is a little high in my opinion, but, I just have my work pay for it, gotta love offsites and being a director of a multi-national corporation.
