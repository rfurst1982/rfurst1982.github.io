**Austin Motor Inn**  
**Austin, Tx**  
Yes, I am the man, the myth, the legend, that others have written about. Now, this place is not much at all, but, the bedsheets are clean when I arrive, and the water is always hot when I'm done, and they never ask questions and take cash. I come here at least once a week to satisfy my urges since the wife is about as interesting as a used, dirty gym sock when it comes to being alive for the beast with two backs. Even better, my company reimburses me becuase I "train" my employees here in their "conference rooms."
