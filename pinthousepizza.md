**Pinthouse Pizza**  
**Austin, TX**   
The food is great, the pizza is great, the seating is questionable during busy times with the communal seating, and there is a lot of eye candy to view which makes the beer and pizza that much better. The big reason  I'm taking away a star is because the staff and customers take my playful chatting and hugging as flirting when I'm just a hugger and grabber. It is a great place to meet new people because the bar scene is played out and we all know cougars and single mothers are where it is at and they come here a lot.
