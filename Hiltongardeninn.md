**Hilton Garden Inn**  
**Austin, TX**   
This used to be my hotel of choice until my wife looked at my credit card bill and put two and two together and realized I was cheating on her with a co-worker. That was a slight mistake that only cost me a few weeks of cheating time that I quickly made up for by now paying cash and calling them business lunches. The rooms here are decent and the walls are thick enough that you don't hear everyone else around you as they are probably cheating on their spouses too. The front desk is great because they don't ask and if anyone comes looking for you, they say they don't have a guest by that name if you pass them a few extra bills.

If you really want to impress your mistress or sugar daddy, stay here once then go stay at one of the haunted rooms in The Driskill for kinky ghost sex three ways.
