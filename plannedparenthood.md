**Planned Parenthood**   
**Austin, TX**   
After I got my mistress pregnant, I needed an abortion and Planned Parenthood was able to help us out economically and quickly. They also provided me propolactics and educated me about other sex acts that won't result in a possible pregnancy. Between the cost of the abortion and the hush money I paid to my mistress aka coworker (I'm a cut rate Elon Musk), I was only out 22k, way cheaper than paying for a kid I didn't want for 18 years. Thanks Planned Parenthood!
